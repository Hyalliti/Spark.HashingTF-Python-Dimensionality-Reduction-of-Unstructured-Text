added the concept of pipe caps. These are pipes that process all their inputs and then simply return a single output    like the butt end of a pipe. Added the first one called CountPipeCap. Added IdentityPipe which does nothing but return its input  this is good for creating test cases. Did some work updating Merge and Split base classes   this is the next big push to really demonstrate the power of pipes. A Pipe is now an Iteratator and an Iterable so you can while hasNext or foreach the results   added test cases to make sure everything behaves correctly. Also a pipe now can take an Iteratble thus you no longer have to Arrays.asList().iterator for the initial setStart.	1

Bugfix: JENKINS 10638 Enhancement: JENKINS 10637 Bugfix: JENKINS 10719 including    New feature: Ignore parent stream   can now tell a project to ignore changes made in the basis stream of the actual stream being built.  This can signficantly reduce the time the plugin takes talking to the accurev server.    New feature: Get streams singly   more of an accurev client workaround really; the plugin used to call the server and get   the streams   which included absolutely everything under the sun and this turns into many megabytes of data every poll and every build.  This server setting says to get just the streams we care about (our stream our parent stream etc) albeit at the cost of potentially making more than one call to the server. Enhancement: Logging improved which should make debugging accurev client failures a little easier. Enhancement: Now weakly caches the XmlPullParserFactory. Refactor: Extracted out code that runs the accurev client command into its own class reducing duplicated code and making parsing of command output more consistent. Refactor: Split out many of AccurevSCM's inner classes into their own files in an attempt to make the main class more maintainable.	1

SRM Space Manager use complete Authorization Record for space reservations instead of single voGroupvoRole pair. This patch modifies the messages that srm uses for communication with the space manager. Therefore this modification requires simultaneous upgrade of the srm and space manager services no other services are affected.  Instead of considering only the primary voGroup and voRole we now look at all vo groups/roles present in AuthorizationRecord when reserving or releasing space in space manager. This patch introduces SpaceManagerAuthorizationPolicy and its implementation SimpleSpaceManagerAuthorizationPolicy. The pluggable policy encapsulate authorization logic  for reserve and release operations.  This patch only addresses the SRM < > SpaceManager communication. it will not affect how doors communicate with SpaceManager when implicit space reservation is needed.	1
Encapsulating the EF/EFV pair regexp	1

Fixed the exception dialog to support longer stack traces.	1
[ADD/MOD] Also split AVLTree into reader/writer whereas the writer encapsulates a reader delegate.	1
Changes to allow cross language call graphs.  The three biggest changes are as follows: 1) The visitors nested in the SSAPropagationCallGraph have become static classes so that they can be reused in a delegation pattern for the cross language call graph builder. 2) The ClassHierarchy is now encapsulated behind an IClassHierarchy interface to allow for a CrossLanguageClassHierarchy that delegates to a set of child hierarchies one for each language.  The internals of the ClassHierarchy are almost entirely unchanged 3) There is now a new Language interface in com.ibm.wala.classLoader and all IClassLoader objects have to know what language they load for.  This language object now encapsulates a few language specific options that were previously hacked into the AnalysisOptions object.	1
Don't allow inheritance in glue code (stepdefs and hooks). Also fixes #257 in a more encapsulated way.	1

ClassId MethodId and MethodName are now fixed constant properties of the codex value.	1

[CXF 4455] Sorting post match filters according to binding priorities	1
Updated the example. Fiexed the sorting of neighbors in CW. The test with the second DT example still fails.	1
Continue to fix the case where PRIORITIZE is used but no priority list is given. While fixing that case I also removed unnecessary sorting when the prioeity list is not provied. When the priority list is not provided it will continue to be null. Thus the number of original Variant Contexts should be given as a new parameter to simpleMerge (since priority might be null). This new parameter is used for checking if there are filtered VC when annotationOrigin is true.	1
